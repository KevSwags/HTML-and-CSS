                <p>Growing up in a low-income Tanzanian family, my parents taught me to maintain high standards for my academic and professional achievements amidst the intangible hierarchical impediments that accompany my identity. I continue to hold myself to these standards as a Computer Science and Economics student all while recognizing the ways in which I can utilize my own privileges to help others who may not have the same access as I do. I have been able to use the theoretical knowledge I have acquired in the classroom in a practical way that has tangible effects on Tanzanians living in the U.S. I am of the strong belief that as a young Black Man from a low-income household, interested in a career within the technology industry, the onus is on me to ensure that technology leaves no one behind. Being involved in local communities now, allows me to ensure that I center small community needs in my future work as a software engineer and web developer. I am often hesitant to recount stories of my childhood, in an attempt not to perpetuate a harmful narrative of the stereotypically undeveloped Africa—i.e. the times when my parents biked with me to the nearest hospital 20 km away from home. During my time at Queens College, I hope to apply for fellowship opportunities that will put me well on my way to achieving my goals of becoming a web developer and software engineer to increase access and equity for New York City communities.</p>

                <h2>HONORS AND AWARDS</h2>
                <p><em>I am proud of the distinctions and awards I received while attending St. John's Preparatory School, including being accepted into the Fordham STEP program and doing exceptionally well in my soccer league. I was able to obtain practical experience in science and technology because to my involvement in the Fordham STEP program, which also assisted me in honing important problem-solving and teamwork skills. I received accolades for my performance and leadership on the soccer field as well as honors for my commitment and hard work. These experiences have improved me as a student and athlete while also teaching me the value of perseverance and determination.</em></p>

                <h2>COMMUNITY SERVICES</h2>
                <p><em>I'm very committed to giving back to my community, and I've had the good fortune to take part in many volunteer activities throughout the years. I have had the opportunity to share my love of mathematics with young pupils as a volunteer math tutor at Bensal Nursery School and assist them in laying a solid foundation in the discipline. As a tour guide and ambassador for St. John's Preparatory Open House, I have also promoted the school to potential parents and shared my own great experiences. In addition, I have participated in the chorus at Immanuel Lutheran Church, where I have had the opportunity to use my musical abilities to uplift and inspire others. These experiences have allowed me to make a positive impact in my community and have taught me the importance of giving back.</em></p>
